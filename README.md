A real, robust compose key for Windows.

Quick start
-----------

 1. Run WinCompose.exe
 2. Press the Right Alt key to initiate a compose sequence
 3. Press the keys for the compose sequence; for instance:
    "," then "c" will type "ç"

Examples
--------

Compose rules are supposed to be intuitive. Here are some examples:

 - ` a → à
 - ' e → é
 - ^ i → î
 - ~ n → ñ
 - / o → ø
 - " u → ü
 - o c → ©
 - + - → ±
 - : - → ÷

Bugs
----

Customising the script requires AutoHotKey (http://www.autohotkey.com/) for now.
The original WinCompose.ahk script file is provided.
